INFOTC 4320 Project 3: Stock Data Visualizer

## Project Requirements:
The application should:
   1. Ask the user to enter the stock symbol for the company they want data for.
   2. Ask the user for the chart type they would like.
   3. Ask the user for the time series function they want the api to use.
   4. Ask the user for the beginning date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
   5. Ask the user for the end date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
   6. The end date should not be before the begin date
   7. Generate a graph and open in the user’s default browser.

## Project Structure Overview:

### Main Module (`main.py`):
- Entry point of the application.
- Orchestrates user interaction, gathers input, and calls necessary functions from other modules.

### User Input Module (`userInput.py`):
- Handles user interaction by providing functions to prompt the user for input.
- Functions include:
  - `getStockSymbol()`: Prompts for the stock symbol.
  - `getChartType()`: Prompts for the chart type.
  - `getTimeSeriesFunction()`: Prompts for the time series function.
  - `getStartDate()`: Prompts for the start date.
  - `getEndDate()`: Prompts for the end date.

### Time Series Functions Module (`timeSeriesFunctions.py`):
- Provides functions to prompt the user for selecting the time series function they want the API to use.
- Functions include:
  - `getTimeSeriesFunction()`: Presents options for choosing time series functions like Intraday, Daily, Weekly, and Monthly.

### Data Fetcher Module (`dataFetcher.py`):
- Responsible for fetching data from the Alpha Vantage API.
- Functions include:
  - `getStockData()`: Constructs API URL based on user input, sends a request, and retrieves JSON response containing stock data.

### Graph Generator Module (`graphGenerator.py`):
- Responsible for generating graphs based on the fetched stock data.
- Functions include:
  - `generateGraph()` to create visual representations of the data, using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly.

### Additional Files:
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore, such as Python bytecode files (*.pyc).

### Workflow:
1. The user runs `main.py` to start the application.
2. They are prompted to input the stock symbol, chart type, time series function, start date, and end date.
3. User input is validated, and the appropriate API URL is constructed.
4. The application fetches data from the Alpha Vantage API using `dataFetcher.py`.
5. If data is successfully retrieved, it's used to generate graphs.
6. Any errors or exceptions encountered during the process are appropriately handled and displayed to the user.
